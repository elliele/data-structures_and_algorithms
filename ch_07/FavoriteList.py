"""
We wish to implement a favorites list by making use of a PositionalList for storage.
If elements of the positional list were simply elements of the favorites list, we
would be challenged to maintain access counts and to keep the proper count with
the associated element as the contents of the list are reordered. We use a general
object-oriented design pattern, the composition pattern, in which we define a single
object that is composed of two or more other objects. Specifically, we define a
nonpublic nested class, Item, that stores the element and its access count as a
single instance. We then maintain our favorites list as a PositionalList of item
instances, so that the access count for a userâ€™s element is embedded alongside it in
our representation. (An Item is never exposed to a user of a FavoritesList.)
